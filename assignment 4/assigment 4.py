# Weather Data Visualization Report

## 1. Introduction
This mini-project analyses a real-world weather dataset using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

The objective is to understand trends in temperature, rainfall, and humidity, and visualize them effectively.

---

## 2. Data Cleaning
- Converted Date column to datetime format  
- Removed unwanted columns  
- Filled missing values using forward fill (ffill)  
- Exported cleaned dataset (`cleaned_weather.csv`)  

---

## 3. Statistical Findings

### Daily Statistics
Daily mean, min, max, and standard deviation computed using Pandas + NumPy.

### Monthly Insights
- Highest temperatures observed in: **May–June**  
- Peak rainfall recorded in: **July–August**  
- Humidity highest during monsoon months  

### Yearly Summary
Shows rising average temperatures yearly — indicates warming trend.

---

## 4. Visualizations
The following plots were generated:

### 1️⃣ Daily Temperature Trend (Line Chart)
Shows clear fluctuations and seasonal patterns.

### 2️⃣ Monthly Rainfall Totals (Bar Chart)
Bar chart shows monsoon dominance.

### 3️⃣ Humidity vs Temperature (Scatter Plot)
Humidity decreases as temperature increases.

### 4️⃣ Combined Plot
Subplot visualization for better comparison.

---

## 5. Conclusions
- Summers show extreme temperatures (peak in May–June)  
- Rainfall highly seasonal (monsoon peak)  
- Humidity strongly correlated with rainfall  
- Temperature appears to rise gradually over years (possible climate shift)

---

## 6. Future Scope
- Add Seaborn heatmaps  
- Build an interactive dashboard using Plotly  
- Automate daily weather report emails
